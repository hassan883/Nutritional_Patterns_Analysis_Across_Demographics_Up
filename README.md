# Nutritional_Patterns_Analysis_Across_Demographics_Up

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to analyzing nutritional data across various demographics and geographic regions. It leverages extensive data from the `year_lsoa_grocery.csv` dataset, containing detailed information on food consumption patterns, nutritional details, and demographic specifics across different areas identified by area IDs.

## Problem Statement
The primary aim of this project is to identify and visualize complex patterns of nutrient intake and eating habits across different demographics and geographic areas. By understanding these patterns, the project seeks to inform public health policies and targeted nutritional interventions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 4,833 records with 202 variables encompassing demographic details and nutritional data for various food groups. This includes metrics like average nutrient intake broken down by demographic groups and geographical areas without any missing values. The data spans nutrients such as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, and includes detailed percentile distributions for these nutrients.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality and consistency across all entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of key variables to understand the underlying patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilize regression models and other statistical tools to uncover relationships between demographic factors and nutritional intake.
- **Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations to represent the consumption patterns and demographic distributions effectively.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
